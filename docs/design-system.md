# Design System

Originally a Phase 3 deliverable; **§ Phase 7 additions** at the end of this
document records the dark-theme re-skin, `StatTile`, and the view-state
pattern added since. Full component/token reference for `ai-learning-web`.
Binding conventions live in `docs/architecture.md` — this document explains
them.

## Philosophy

An AI-native learning workspace, not an admin dashboard. The visual language takes
cues from Apple, Linear, Notion, Raycast, Cursor, Vercel and Arc: calm, minimal,
content-forward, quietly premium. Concretely:

- **Restraint over decoration.** Soft shadows, not material elevation. Motion that
  clarifies state changes, never motion for its own sake.
- **Tokens, always.** Every color, spacing, radius, shadow, font size, and duration in
  a component traces back to a token. If a value isn't in `tokens.css`, it doesn't
  belong in a component's `<style>` block.
- **Semantic naming.** Tokens describe role (`--color-danger`, `--radius-card`), never
  the raw value (no `--red-500`, no `--8px`). This is what lets the whole product
  re-skin from one file.

## Token architecture

All tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css` (base scales + light/dark values) and
`src/styles/motion.css` (transition/keyframe tokens). `src/styles/element-theme.css`
maps Element Plus's internal variables onto these tokens so EP components inherit the
same language instead of their default "admin" look.

### Typography

Two layers: primitives (`--text-xs` … `--text-3xl`, `--leading-*`, `--tracking-*`) and
a semantic scale built on top of them:

| Token prefix | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--font-display-*` | Hero/marketing-weight headings. Responsive via `clamp()`. |
| `--font-headline-*` | Page titles (`AppPageHeader`). |
| `--font-title-*` | Section/card titles (`AppSection`, `AppCard`). |
| `--font-body-*` | Default reading text. |
| `--font-caption-*` | Secondary/supporting text. |
| `--font-label-*` | Uppercase-style micro labels (form labels, eyebrow text). |

Each has `-family`, `-size`, `-weight`, `-leading`, `-tracking` sub-tokens.
`--font-mono` is the monospace family for code/data.

### Color

Semantic roles, not raw hues — every role has a light and dark value in `tokens.css`:

`primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info` (each with a `-soft`
tint for backgrounds and `-hover`/`-active` where interactive), plus `bg`, `surface`,
`surface-hover`, `border`, `border-strong`, `muted`, `muted-soft`, `overlay` (backdrop
scrim), `text`/`text-secondary`/`text-tertiary`, and `focus-ring`.

### Spacing

4px-rooted scale: `--space-0-5` (2px) through `--space-24` (96px), matching the
requested 8px rhythm (`--space-2` = 8px, `--space-4` = 16px, …) while keeping a 4px
half-step for tight UI (icon gaps, tag padding).

### Radius

Base scale `--radius-sm/md/lg/xl/full`, plus semantic aliases components actually
consume: `--radius-button`, `--radius-input`, `--radius-card`, `--radius-dialog`,
`--radius-panel`, `--radius-glass`. Change the alias, not the component, to retune a
surface's roundedness.

### Shadow

`--shadow-sm/md/lg` for resting elevation, `--shadow-float` for popovers/dropdowns,
`--shadow-glass` for translucent floating surfaces (dialog, drawer). Every shadow has
a distinct dark-mode value — dark shadows use higher opacity black, not the same
rgba as light mode.

**`--shadow-glow-primary`** (Phase 7): a very-low-alpha purple halo applied to
exactly three interactive-emphasis surfaces — `AppButton`'s solid-primary
variant at rest, `AppSidebar`'s active nav item at rest, `AppCard`'s
interactive variant on hover/focus. Never ambient. Light mode's value is a
**zero-alpha shadow, not the `none` keyword**
(`0 0 0 0 rgba(94, 106, 210, 0)`) — `box-shadow` cannot mix the `none`
keyword into a comma-separated value list alongside a real shadow, so any
future theme-conditional shadow token that needs to be "real in one theme,
invisible in the other" should reuse this zero-alpha-shadow trick rather than
branching the component's CSS per theme.

### Glass tokens

`--glass-bg`, `--glass-border`, `--glass-blur`, `--glass-highlight` back the
glass `AppCard` variant and the `.el-dialog`/`.el-drawer` surfaces. **Since
Phase 7**, dark mode's glass is more translucent and more blurred than light
(`--glass-blur` 28px vs 20px, `--glass-bg` alpha 0.64 vs 0.72) with a
violet-tinted `--glass-border`/`--glass-highlight` instead of plain white —
every glass surface (`AppCard`'s `.variant-glass`, the EP dialog/drawer
bridge) applies `inset 0 1px 0 var(--glass-highlight)` for a consistent
"physical top edge," a treatment `GlassScene`'s login/welcome experience used
first and this phase made universal. The independent `--scene-*` token set
(the login/welcome flower experience) is intentionally untouched by this —
it shares only `--glass-highlight` with the rest of the app, nothing else.

### Motion

`--duration-fast/base/slow` + `--ease-out/in-out/spring` in `tokens.css`;
`--motion-scale-hover/press` and the `app-fade` / `app-scale` / `app-slide-up` /
`app-slide-down` keyframes + Vue `<Transition>` name classes in `motion.css`. All
motion is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

### Breakpoints

Fixed reference values, documented (not tokenized — CSS media queries can't consume
custom properties): `640 / 768 / 1024 / 1280`. Components hard-code these literals in
`@media` rules; `AppLayout`'s sidebar collapse uses `768px`.

## Component library

`src/components/` — flat file layout, one component per file, explicit named exports
from `src/components/index.ts`. No auto-import: this mirrors `vite.config.ts`'s
`unplugin-vue-components`, which is deliberately scoped to Element Plus only.

### Custom, token-built (signature surfaces)

`AppButton`, `AppInput`, `AppCard`, `AppAvatar`, `AppTag`, `AppBadge`, `AppEmpty`,
`AppLoading`, `AppSkeleton`, `AppSection`, `AppPageHeader`, `AppSearch`,
`StatTile` (Phase 7 — see § Phase 7 additions).

These own their full visual implementation — no Element Plus underneath — because
they're either simple enough to hand-roll (avatar, tag, badge) or are the product's
signature look-and-feel surfaces where full control matters (button, input, card).

### Themed wrappers over Element Plus (complex primitives)

`AppDialog`, `AppDrawer`, `AppTooltip`, `AppPagination`.

Positioning, focus-trap, Esc-to-close, and popper placement are hard problems EP has
already solved correctly and accessibly. These wrappers restyle the EP output via
`element-theme.css` (glass surfaces for dialog/drawer, dark popper for tooltip,
token-driven radius for pagination) rather than reimplementing that logic — matching
the constitution's "EP for complex primitives" rule.

### Shared vocabulary

`src/components/types.ts`: `Size` (`sm|md|lg`), `Tone` (`primary|secondary|success|
warning|danger|info`), `ButtonVariant`, `CardVariant`. Reuse these unions in new
components instead of inventing parallel ones.

### Conventions

- TypeScript props via `defineProps<T>()` + `withDefaults`; emits via `defineEmits<T>`.
- Two-way state via `defineModel` (not manual `modelValue`/`update:modelValue` wiring).
- Every color/spacing/radius/shadow/duration in `<style scoped>` is a `var(--token)` —
  no literals except pixel values that are themselves the scale's raw output (e.g. an
  icon-tile's fixed layout width).
- `:focus-visible` is never suppressed; the global ring (`base.css`) covers most
  interactive elements automatically because native `button`/`input`/`a` elements are
  used, not `div`s with click handlers.
- Icon-only interactive elements always carry `aria-label`.

## Icon strategy

`AppIcon` is the **only** file (besides `src/components/icons/registry.ts`) allowed to
import from the underlying icon library (`lucide-vue-next`). Application code requests
icons by string name:

```vue
<AppIcon name="search" size="sm" />
```

`registry.ts` maps `IconName` (a string-literal union) to the actual Lucide component.
Swapping icon providers later — a different library, a self-hosted sprite sheet — means
editing only `registry.ts` and `AppIcon.vue`; no call site changes.

## Theme engine

`src/stores/app.ts` owns theme state: `light | dark | system`, persisted to
`localStorage`, reactive to OS `prefers-color-scheme` changes when in `system` mode,
applied via the `html.dark` class (`stores/app.ts` → `applyTheme()`). Every token in
`tokens.css` has a value under `:root` (light) and an override under `html.dark`.

**Extension point**: a `glass` mode is not implemented, but the tokens it would need
(`--glass-*`) already exist and are already used by floating surfaces. Adding it later
means extending the `ThemeMode` union and adding a second class toggle
(`html.theme-glass` or similar) — no restructuring.

## Layout system

`src/layouts/`:

- `AppHeader.vue` — thin top bar, visible only below the `768px` breakpoint. Carries
  the mobile nav toggle.
- `AppSidebar.vue` — brand, nav, and the theme/locale/user controls. Rendered twice:
  once as the always-visible desktop rail, once inside `AppDrawer` for mobile (same
  component, no duplicated markup).
- `AppLayout.vue` — composes header + static sidebar + mobile drawer + `<RouterView>`
  content area. Responsive collapse is pure CSS (`display: none` past the breakpoint)
  plus one `ref` for the drawer's open state — no resize listeners.

## Accessibility baseline

- Every custom interactive component is a native `button`/`input`/`a` — keyboard
  operability and correct semantics come for free.
- Global `:focus-visible` ring driven by `--color-focus-ring` (`base.css`).
- Icon-only controls require `aria-label`; decorative icons are `aria-hidden`.
- `AppLoading`/`AppEmpty` expose `role="status"`; form errors use `role="alert"` and
  `aria-describedby`.
- Complex overlay a11y (focus trap, `aria-modal`, `Esc` handling) is inherited from
  Element Plus in the wrapped components — not reimplemented.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all token-driven animation globally.

## Verification / living reference

`/design-system` (route `design-system`, inside the authenticated `AppLayout`, not
linked from nav) renders every component in its variants — use it to eyeball tokens
and components together, in both themes and both locales, rather than trusting this
document alone.

## Phase 7 additions

### Dark theme: black+purple luxury identity

`html.dark`'s neutral ramp in `tokens.css` carries a low-saturation ~248°
indigo-violet hue through every step instead of a flat gray-black ramp:
`--color-bg` `#0a0910` → `--color-surface` `#12101a` →
`--color-surface-hover` `#191823` → `--color-border` `#262433` →
`--color-border-strong` `#343243` → `--color-muted`/`--color-text-tertiary`
`#6e6b80`. Chosen and validated with a WCAG relative-luminance contrast check
against the previous shipped ramp (every ratio meets or beats the prior
baseline — see `docs/phase7-final-report.md` § Verification for the exact
numbers) rather than by eye. `--color-primary` and its interactive steps were
left unchanged — already validated in an earlier phase. Light mode received
only the pre-existing micro-polish; this re-skin is dark-mode-only by design.
The categorical accent palette (subject identity, chart series) needed no hex
changes — re-validated against the new dark surface with the dataviz skill's
`scripts/validate_palette.js`, still all-checks-pass. **Any future change to
`--color-surface` in either mode must re-run that validation** — it is
surface-color-dependent, not a one-time check.

The Element Plus CSS-variable bridge (`element-theme.css`) needed **zero**
component-specific overrides for dark mode — confirmed by driving the
Calendar date/time picker and an AI-Tutor `el-select` in dark mode; the
existing generic variable mapping renders both correctly.

### View-state pattern

Every view that loads async data follows one sequence, driven by the
`useAsync<T>` composable (`data`/`loading`/`error`/`reload`):
**Skeleton → content | `AppEmpty` | error-with-retry**. Skeleton shapes match
their view's final layout (block counts and heights line up with the real
stat-tile rows / chart panels they stand in for) rather than a generic
shimmer rectangle. Error state renders `t(error.messageKey)` plus a
`common.retry` action wired to `reload()`. Views that let the user mutate a
list item keep a local working copy synced from `data` via a `watch`, so an
optimistic edit doesn't get clobbered by the next background reload.

### `StatTile`

A single token-built component (`src/components/StatTile.vue`) rendering a
labeled metric with an optional trend indicator, used by Workspace (streak,
study-progress ring, due cards, active subjects) and Profile (learning-overview
stats) — the two views that previously hand-rolled nearly identical tile
markup. Introduced once a second real consumer existed, per the constitution's
"new shared code needs ≥2 real consumers" rule. Nullable trend values
(`weekDeltaPercent`-style metrics with no prior-period baseline) render `—`,
never a fabricated `0%`. Shown in its own section of `/design-system`.

### UX unification pass

Consistent spacing/typography/dialog/hover/focus-visible/transition tokens
across every dialog and interactive surface added since Phase 5; skeleton
shapes audited against final layouts (see above); keyboard reachability
confirmed for every dialog (`AppDialog` inherits `el-dialog`'s native
focus-trap/Esc handling — nothing reimplemented); `prefers-reduced-motion`
confirmed still disables the pointer-driven glass spotlight effect
(`useSpotlight`) as well as all keyframe motion. A dedicated toast/message
primitive was considered and **deliberately not built** — audited need was
exactly two background-persist error surfaces app-wide (Settings' preference
controls, and `AppSidebar`'s quick theme/locale chips, which intentionally
swallow their own errors since the collapsed rail has no room for an inline
line), both already served by the existing inline-error-line pattern. Building
a shared component for two call sites would be a premature abstraction; the
trigger to reconsider is a third distinct background-persist-error surface
appearing, not a fixed phase or step number.

## Explicitly out of scope (Phase 3)

No business modules, no AI features, no dashboards, no login redesign. The premium
login experience and the full glass theme are Phase 4+.
