/**
 * One graded review — an immutable, append-only event (Phase 15). Together the
 * logs are the review history: the retention/analytics source and the input a
 * future FSRS parameter optimizer replays. {@code rating} and {@code state} are
 * stored as their integer codes ({@code Rating.value()} / {@code ReviewState.value()});
 * conversion to the enums happens at the service boundary, keeping the pure
 * {@code review} package free of persistence concerns.
